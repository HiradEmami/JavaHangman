# JavaHangman
This application is a supportive tool for iOS application of Hangman (Swift 3)


You can find the Swift hangman application repository at : https://github.com/Isachenko/Hangman


Please note that, JavaHangman application is meant to convert word/letter list (in form of note files) to specific Word/letter chunks of Act-R and includes a small hangman application that allows players to play a round while the application would track the letters used.


The format of the chunks are specific to iOS hangman game and would not work in different projects that have different structure. 


This application is uploaded for feature reference and as a mean to communicate with teammembers of main Swift projects

HOW TO RUN 
There are sample input note files for  letters and words.  Before running the game, please import word files so that the application has its database of the words, then you can play hangman game with one of the words randomly being selected for each round
